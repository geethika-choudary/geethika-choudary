👋🏼 Hi, I’m Geethika Choudary Payyaula, a Software Engineer who pursued Prof Masters in CS at Simon Fraser University, Canada.
👩🏻‍💻 When I'm not solving coding problems, you might catch me at a pilates class or doing something artsy like pottery, painting and origami.
📚 I’m currently learning about Deep Learning and Prompt Engineering in my free time.
🌱 Let's chat about Software Development, Machine Learning or your latest creative project.
📫 You can reach me at geethikachoudary7@gmail.com

✨ Fun fact: I love trying different types of hot sauces (borderline gut wrenching)
